  <p>Spare Change Cycling is the best way to search for your next ride.  For your convenience, 
  we aggregate 
  craigslist posts into our data.  
  </p><p>However, we can only guess as to what category
  a craigslist post will land in.  If you are having trouble finding results, you may
  want to choose more categories, or choose 'any' to search all categories.  Further, 
  if you are not getting any results from your specific area code, try upping the distance
  from your location.</p>
